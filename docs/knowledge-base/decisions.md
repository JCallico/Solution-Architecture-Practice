# Architecture Decisions

> ⚠️ **Content Pending** - Decision repository is being developed.

## Overview

Repository of significant architecture decisions made across projects, using the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) format.

## Coming Soon

### Decision Categories
- Technology selection decisions
- Architectural pattern choices
- Infrastructure decisions
- Security architecture decisions
- Data architecture decisions
- Integration approach decisions

### Decision Format

Each decision will follow the ADR template:
- **Title**: Short description of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
- **Decision**: What is the change we're proposing and/or doing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult because of this change?
- **Alternatives Considered**: What other options were evaluated?
- **Related Decisions**: Links to related ADRs

### Sample Decisions

Examples that will be documented:
- Choosing microservices over monolithic architecture
- Selecting cloud provider
- API architecture (REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC)
- Database selection (SQL vs NoSQL)
- Message broker selection
- CI/CD tooling choices
- Monitoring and observability stack
- Container orchestration platform

## How to Use

1. Review existing decisions before making new ones
2. Learn from past decision rationale
3. Understand the evolution of our architecture
4. Use as templates for documenting new decisions
