# Technology Radar

> ⚠️ **Content Pending** - Technology Radar is being developed.

## Overview

Our technology radar helps teams understand which technologies, tools, frameworks, and practices we recommend for adoption.

## Coming Soon

### Radar Structure

Technologies are categorized into four rings:
1. **Adopt**: Technologies we have high confidence in and recommend for appropriate use cases
2. **Trial**: Technologies worth pursuing in projects that can handle the risk
3. **Assess**: Technologies to explore with the goal of understanding how they'll affect your enterprise
4. **Hold**: Technologies to avoid for new projects

### Categories

- **Languages & Frameworks**
- **Tools**
- **Platforms**
- **Techniques & Practices**

### Current Technologies

The radar will track:
- Programming languages (Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, etc.)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Container technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, ECS, etc.)
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)
- Message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS, etc.)
- API technologies (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- DevOps tools (Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions)
- Observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Datadog)

### Update Process

- Reviewed quarterly by the architecture team
- Changes discussed in Architecture Review Board
- Input solicited from development teams
- Published updates with rationale
