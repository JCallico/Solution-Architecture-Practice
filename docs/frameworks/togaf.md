# TOGAF Framework

The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is an enterprise architecture methodology and framework.

## Overview

TOGAF provides a comprehensive approach to the design, planning, implementation, and governance of enterprise information architecture.

**Current Version:** TOGAF 10 (as of 2022)

## Key Components

### 1. Architecture Development Method (ADM)
The ADM is the core of TOGAF - an iterative process model for developing enterprise architecture.

**ADM Phases:**
- **Preliminary Phase** - Framework and principles
- **Phase A: Architecture Vision** - Scope, stakeholders, vision
- **Phase B: Business Architecture** - Business strategy, governance, organization
- **Phase C: Information Systems Architecture** - Data and application architecture
- **Phase D: Technology Architecture** - Logical and physical technology
- **Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions** - Implementation planning
- **Phase F: Migration Planning** - Detailed migration plans
- **Phase G: Implementation Governance** - Architecture compliance
- **Phase H: Architecture Change Management** - Change management process
- **Requirements Management** - Continuous throughout

### 2. Architecture Content Framework
Provides a structural model for architectural outputs:
- Deliverables
- Artifacts
- Building Blocks

###3. Enterprise Continuum
Classification system for architecture assets from generic to specific:
- Foundation Architectures
- Common Systems Architectures
- Industry Architectures
- Organization-Specific Architectures

### 4. Architecture Repository
Structure for storing architecture assets:
- Architecture Metamodel
- Architecture Landscape
- Standards Information Base
- Reference Library
- Governance Log

## When to Use TOGAF

✅ **Good For:**
- Large enterprise transformations
- Establishing enterprise architecture practice
- Complex multi-domain initiatives
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Long-term strategic planning

❌ **Consider Alternatives For:**
- Small, fast-moving projects
- Startup environments
- Single-application designs
- Tactical solutions

## Integration with Our Practice

We use TOGAF principles adapted for our context:

- **ADM Phases** - Informguidance for major initiatives
- **Architecture Repository** - Structure for our knowledge base
- **Governance Framework** - Basis for our [Governance Framework](../leadership/governance-framework.md)
- **Content Framework** - Template for architecture deliverables

## Resources

### Official Resources
- TOGAF Standard (https://www.opengroup.org/togaf)
- TOGAF Library (documentation and guides)
- The Open Group certification program

### Internal Resources
- [Enterprise Architecture Vision](./docs/templates/documents/architecture-vision-template.md)
- [Architecture Decision Process](../processes/decision-process.md)

### Training
- TOGAF 10 Foundation certification course
- TOGAF 10 Practitioner certification course

## Best Practices

1. **Adapt, Don't Adopt** - Tailor TOGAF to your organization
2. **Iterate** - Use ADM iteratively, not as waterfall
3. **Focus on Value** - Skip phases that don't add value
4. **Keep It Lightweight** - Avoid over-documentation
5. **Integrate with Agile** - Combine with agile delivery methods
