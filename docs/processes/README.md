### Common Workflows

#### Starting a New Project
1. Review [Engagement Model](./engagement-model.md)
2. Submit architecture service request
3. Initial architecture consultation
4. Follow [Solution Design Lifecycle](./solution-design-lifecycle.md)
5. Submit to [ARB](./arb/README.md) for review
6. Implement with architecture support

#### Making a Significant Architecture Decision
1. Document options and trade-offs
2. Create [ADR](../frameworks/adr-framework.md)
3. Get peer architect review
4. Present to ARB if required
5. Communicate decision to stakeholders

#### Adopting New Technology
1. Follow [Technology Evaluation Process](./technology-evaluation.md)
2. Create evaluation document
3. Run proof of concept
4. Present findings to Architecture Council
5. Get approval for adoption
6. Document in technology radar

## Process Principles

### Keep It Simple
- Processes should enable, not impede
- Minimize bureaucracy
- Focus on value-added activities

### Be Flexible
- Tailor process to project size and risk
- Allow for expedited reviews when appropriate
- Adapt based on feedback

### Maintain Quality
- Don't compromise on critical reviews
- Ensure adequate peer review
- Document decisions thoroughly

### Be Transparent
- Clear criteria and expectations
- Visible status and timelines
- Open communication

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular process retrospectives
- Collect and act on feedback
- Benchmark against industry practices
- Evolve processes based on learnings

## Process Ownership

### Architecture Review Board (ARB)
- **Owner**: Director of Solution Architecture
- **Members**: Principal Architects, Domain Experts
- **Cadence**: Weekly
- **Purpose**: Review and approve significant architecture decisions

### Architecture Council
- **Owner**: Director of Solution Architecture
- **Members**: All architects
- **Cadence**: Monthly
- **Purpose**: Knowledge sharing, standards review, community building

### Technology Evaluation Committee
- **Owner**: Principal Architects
- **Members**: Domain experts, interested architects
- **Cadence**: As needed
- **Purpose**: Evaluate and approve new technologies

### Standards Working Group
- **Owner**: Rotating Principal Architect
- **Members**: Architects from each domain
- **Cadence**: Quarterly
- **Purpose**: Review and update architecture standards

## Process Metrics

We measure process effectiveness through:

### Cycle Time
- Time from request to initial response
- Time from submission to ARB decision
- Time for technology evaluations

### Quality
- Defect rates in architecture-reviewed systems
- Technical debt in new systems
- Security findings in reviewed systems

### Satisfaction
- Stakeholder satisfaction with process
- Architecture team satisfaction
- Process compliance rate

### Efficiency
- Process overhead (% of project time)
- Review meeting efficiency
- Documentation completeness

## Getting Help with Processes

### Questions About Processes
- **Slack**: #architecture-processes
- **Email**: solution-architecture@company.com
- **Office Hours**: Daily architecture office hours

### Process Improvement Suggestions
