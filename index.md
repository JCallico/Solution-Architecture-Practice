# Solution Architecture Practice

Welcome to the Solution Architecture Practice repository. This comprehensive guide covers architecture frameworks, methodologies, patterns, and best practices for designing scalable, resilient, and maintainable systems.

## 📚 Documentation Structure

### [Frameworks & Methodologies](./docs/frameworks)
Core architecture frameworks and approaches:
- **TOGAF** - The Open Group Architecture Framework
- **Well-Architected Frameworks** - AWS and Azure best practices
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** - Strategic design approach
- **Microservices Architecture** - Service-oriented design
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Asynchronous event patterns
- **API-First Design** - Contract-driven development
- **Serverless Architecture** - Managed compute services
- **Twelve-Factor App** - Cloud-native design principles
- And [more frameworks...](./docs/frameworks)

### [Architecture Patterns](./docs/patterns)
Common architectural patterns and their applications

### [Knowledge Base](./docs/knowledge-base)
Detailed explanations of architectural concepts

### [Leadership & Governance](./docs/leadership)
Architecture governance, decision-making, and organizational aspects

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Browse by Framework**: Start with the [Frameworks & Methodologies](./docs/frameworks) section
2. **Learn Patterns**: Explore common [architecture patterns](./docs/patterns)
3. **Understand Concepts**: Dive into the [knowledge base](./docs/knowledge-base)
4. **Governance**: Review [leadership and governance](./docs/leadership) practices

## 📖 Featured Frameworks

### Cloud Architecture
- [AWS Well-Architected](./docs/frameworks/aws-well-architected.md) - 6 pillars of architectural excellence
- [Azure Well-Architected](./docs/frameworks/azure-well-architected.md) - 5 pillars for Azure success
- [Cloud Architecture](./docs/frameworks/cloud-architecture.md) - Multi-cloud and migration strategies

### Application Design
- [Microservices Architecture](./docs/frameworks/microservices.md) - Decomposing large applications
- [Event-Driven Architecture](./docs/frameworks/event-driven-architecture.md) - Asynchronous system design
- [Serverless Architecture](./docs/frameworks/serverless.md) - Function-based computing

### Integration & APIs
- [API-First Design](./docs/frameworks/api-first.md) - Contract-driven API development
- [Integration Architecture](./docs/frameworks/integration-architecture.md) - System integration patterns

### Design & Documentation
- [Architecture Modeling](./docs/frameworks/architecture-modeling.md) - Visualization and communication
- [Documentation Standards](./docs/frameworks/documentation-standards.md) - Documentation best practices
- [Diagram Standards](./docs/frameworks/diagram-standards.md) - Visual communication guidelines

### Security & Data
- [Security Architecture](./docs/frameworks/security-architecture.md) - Security controls and patterns
- [Data Architecture](./docs/frameworks/data-architecture.md) - Data platform design

## 🎯 Use Cases

**Enterprise Transformation**: Use TOGAF + Well-Architected Frameworks + Domain-Driven Design

**Cloud Migration**: Use Cloud Architecture + Well-Architected Frameworks + Twelve-Factor

**Microservices Platform**: Use Microservices + Domain-Driven Design + Integration Architecture

**Modern SaaS**: Use Twelve-Factor + API-First + Serverless + Event-Driven

**Data Platform**: Use Data Architecture + Security Architecture + Well-Architected

## 📋 Key Principles

- **Loosely Coupled**: Services independent and can evolve separately
- **Highly Cohesive**: Related functionality grouped together
- **Resilient**: Design for failure, recovery, and scalability
- **Observable**: Monitor, log, trace, and alert on system behavior
- **Secure**: Defense in depth with multiple layers of protection
- **Cost-Conscious**: Optimize for operational and infrastructure costs
- **Automated**: Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD, and self-service
